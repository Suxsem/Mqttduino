# **MQTTDUINO** #<br />

###An MQTT client for Arduinos connected to an esp8266 board

<br />
# 1) Connect esp8266 to Arduino
DISCLAIMER! I have NOT much experience in electronics, this is MY connection diagram and it's working well for me, but I don't know if it's 100% correct<br />
<br />

# 2) Install nodemcu lua firmware on esp8266
I'm using 20150213 version, you can use any version from 20150212, hoping that future releases will not break compatibility with the script<br />
You can find it there: https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-firmware


# 3) Push mqttduino script on esp8266
Copy mqttduino.lua and init.lua on the esp8266<br />
You can do it with LuaLoader: http://benlo.com/esp8266/<br />
Don't forget to reboot the esp8266 after copying files


# 4) The Arduino sketch
The mqttduino.ino is a template for your sketch.<br />
The template is self-explanatory
